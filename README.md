# data-scrambler

This is the repo where we store data and code for the git / documentation training. 

## Workshop Outline

This workshop will get students to think about best practices when coding including:

### DRY / Modularity

### Expressiveness

### Style Guides 

### Documentation

****

# Lesson 01 
## Part 1 - 40 minutes?

### A. Small group activity. 15 mins 
View code (printed out??). Identify problems in small groups 2-3.
Share with the group. Have them list issues in the 4 categories above on the white board  

Review all issues on the whiteboard...

### B. Summary mini "lecture" / discussion 20

### Maybe one page of website material??

### TO DOs:
Point them to the code on github... let them create a list of issues. 
Make sure code captures all of the stuff we want to call attention to. 

# Lesson 02 
## Part 2 - 

### What are the steps?

Write out the steps together as a class

* define file path 
* open file <- 
* clean up column x
* group 
* summary stat 

Define pseudo code.
Talk about using it in the code

We help them translate to the R functions for each step

* readr::read_csv
* mutate()
* group_by()
* summarise()


* everything is a dataframe & want to get a data frame back...
* df as the VIP!

### TO DOs:

* add a second site, create fake data around that site. this will allow us to explore the data and see "how many sites" and realize the text cleaning issues in the file
* create overview page on these functions only <- refer to R for Data Science lessons... 

###  OYO Part 3 -- Process a few more files 10 minutes

Ask them to process a few more files
Give them questions -- to discuss as a group
1. what problems do they encounter? (na's)
2. Is there a more efficient way

# Lesson 03
## Part 4 Iteration

* How do you read in a list of files
* bind_rows them together into a single dataframe (map)
* split() out 2 csvs (one for each site?) 

* provide list of file names in csv format 

#### OYO

Add group and summarize the data before outputting the 


To dos:
* Provide example of for loop on the website as a "you could do this but"
* Teach the map / (lapply alternative) way to

## Summary

* looking at the code ... have we achieved our goals? 

****
maybe a plotting example but don't teach this
### Part 5 plot

COuld be example lesson with some simple examples
